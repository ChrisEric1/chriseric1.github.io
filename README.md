# FAQ

Q: Why do I need the extension?

A: Discord blocks other sites using CORS and only extensions will work, you could also host a CORS proxy, which isn't recommended since the person hosting is more likely to get IP banned rather than the person actually using it.

Q: Antivirus flags your files?

A: Executables are currently unsigned.
